            <p>plot-Henry (Adam Sandler) happens to meet Lucy at a restaurant and falls in love with her at first sight.<br/>
              But Lucy, who thought she had fallen for Henry's flashy mouth,
              The next day, I don't even remember him, treating him shamelessly.<br/>
              Because Lucy suffers from amnesia due to a car accident and lives on the day of the accident.<br/> To win Lucy's heart, Henry tries constantly, and the end is happy ending.</p>
            <p>introduction-When the movie was released in 2004, the movie set "short-term amnesia" and the hilarious yet romantic love story <br/>were so much loved that it topped the box office for two consecutive weeks. At first, the title was so childish that I thought it would be a rustic movie,<br/> but I was very impressed to see it later. The film's exotic Hawaiian landscape has even created a desire to travel.</p>

      <p>Slime, a toy product manufactured by Mattel, was first introduced in February 1976 as it was sold as a plastic wastebasket.of nontoxic, viscous, slender, flowing green or other colored material made of guacam.<br/> I often made slimes with my younger brothers. I like slime because I like the feeling of touching it.<br/>But slime is very dry and storage method is important, so I am always sad that I cannot play for a long time.<br/>Slimes are so popular that they upload videos that many YouTubers also play with.</p>

        <p>When you receive flowers from an acquaintance, you can make and store a dryflower and keep it for the first time. I like flowers and I like to decorate my room, so whenever I get flowers as a gift, I always make a dry-flower to decorate my room. It's hard to make a dryflower and it's been a lot of failures, but I'm so happy when it's done beautifully.</p>
